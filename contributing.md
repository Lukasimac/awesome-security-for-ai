# Contributing

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Read [the awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) and ensure your entry complies.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make sure your entry is useful before submitting. That implies it having a good succinct description and solving problems well. 
  * **Do not submit products that have a waitlist or are "coming soon."**
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for an entry: 
  * `* [Company and product name](link) -- Short description with leading capital and no trailing period`
    * Description should be a concise sentence, not a paragraph and not a compound, comprehensive, multi-line, run-on, detailed-oriented marketing piece.
    * Description should be a clear "what it is/does" statement without superlatives like "the industry's best xyz" or "easy to use abc".
  * If the product is open source, indicate the license using a badge that follows the description and make the badge link to the repo (important for when a product page differs from the code repo link). Use the following markdown syntax:
    * `[![code](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ORGNAME/REPONAME)](https://github.com/ORGNAME/REPONAME/)`
    * If the code is hosted somewhere other than GitHub, look through the [badge license options](https://shields.io/badges/git-hub-license) to find the right one
* New links should be **added to the bottom** of the relevant category.
* New categories or suggestions for improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* The pull request and commit should have a useful title like "Adding XYZ to ABC category" or "Updating XYZ description".
  * Detailed instructions on making a PR, including a walkthrough can be found in the [main awesome contributing doc](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md).
* If applicable, please update both the `README.md` and the `awesome-ai-security-infographic.svg`.

Thank you for your suggestions!
