# Contributing

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Read [the awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) and ensure your entry complies.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your entry is useful before submitting. That implies it having a good succinct description and solving problems well.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Use the following format: `* [Solution Name](link) -- description`
  - Description is a concise sentence, not a paragraph or compound, comprehensive, multi-line, run-on, unnecessarily detailed sentence.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- More detailed instructions and a walkthrough can be found in the [main awesome contributing doc](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md).
- If applicable, consider contributing to both the `README.md` and to `awesome-ai-security-infographic.svg` as well.

Thank you for your suggestions!
