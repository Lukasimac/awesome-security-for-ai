# Awesome Security Solutions for AI Systems [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome solutions to hard AI security problems and risks.  This stands in contrast to using AI for security (for offense or defense) and is explicitly meant to link to software and solutions that help solve the problems

Other lists cover the many excellent frameworks, papers, attacks, safety, and so forth.  But new GenAI systems are subject to all new classes of attacks and it has been difficult to find projects and companies that solve these problems as they rarely shine through the noise of "ai security" as a phrase.
